# Avalonia Controls and Windowing

Start with:

- `../../references/70-avalonia-12-source-and-reference-baseline.md`
- `../../references/10-templated-controls-and-control-themes.md`
- `../../references/13-windowing-and-custom-decorations.md`
- `../../references/48-toplevel-window-and-runtime-services.md`

Load these based on the requested surface:

- `../../references/25-popups-flyouts-tooltips-and-overlays.md`
- `../../references/52-controls-reference-catalog.md`
- `../../references/53-menu-controls-contextmenu-and-menuflyout-patterns.md`
- `../../references/54-native-menu-and-native-menubar-integration.md`
- `../../references/55-tray-icons-and-system-tray-integration.md`
- `../../references/56-managed-notifications-and-window-notification-manager.md`

## Workflow

1. Separate control contract, template, and host surface concerns.
2. Pick the right top-level surface: window, popup, flyout, native menu, tray, or in-app notification.
3. Use the controls catalog only as a quick lookup after the workflow docs have narrowed the direction.
4. Validate platform-specific window or popup behavior explicitly.

## Rules

- Keep template parts and visual states documented in the implementation.
- Avoid mixing shell, popup, and notification logic into one control when host services are a better fit.
- Treat per-platform chrome and tray behavior as opt-in integration work.
