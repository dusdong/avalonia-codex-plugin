# Avalonia Layout and Virtualization

Start with:

- `../../references/70-avalonia-12-source-and-reference-baseline.md`
- `../../references/30-layout-measure-arrange-and-custom-layout-controls.md`
- `../../references/21-custom-layout-authoring.md`
- `../../references/20-itemscontrol-virtualization-and-recycling.md`

Load these when scrolling or templates are involved:

- `../../references/57-scrollviewer-offset-anchoring-and-snap-points.md`
- `../../references/38-data-templates-and-idatatemplate-selector-patterns.md`

## Evidence Discipline

- Avalonia 12 source facts: verify APIs, package behavior, target frameworks, and platform behavior against `../../references/70-avalonia-12-source-and-reference-baseline.md` and the local `frameworks/Avalonia` source tree before making default recommendations.
- Avalonia 12 project patterns: use only the allowed Avalonia 12 projects named in the baseline/reference-project evidence for product architecture, UI composition, and engineering patterns.
- Avalonia 11.x migration contrast: mention legacy Avalonia 11.x behavior only when the task is explicitly about migration, compatibility risk, or anti-patterns; never promote it as default Avalonia 12 guidance.

## Workflow

1. Define layout contract first: desired size, final arrangement, invalidation rules.
2. Use built-in panels and recycling paths before creating a custom panel.
3. Verify how virtualization, scrolling, and templates interact on large data sets.
4. Measure before and after changes when performance is the reason for the work.

## Rules

- Use `InvalidateMeasure` and `InvalidateArrange` deliberately.
- Avoid per-item heavy logic inside measuring and arranging hot paths.
- Keep virtualization-friendly templates light and deterministic.
